INSTRUCTIONS FOR ADDING VIDEO

1. Add your "Paradisio - Bailando" music video file to this folder
2. Rename the file to "bailando.mp4"
3. Make sure the file is in MP4 format for best compatibility
4. Open index.html in your browser to experience the website

About the Scale-Reactive Video:
- The video will react to the music by scaling, rotating, and moving
- There's a 15% padding around the video so it remains fully visible during scaling effects
- Bass beats will make the video pulse/scale up and down
- Mid frequencies will add slight rotation for a dynamic feel
- High frequencies will add subtle movement

The reactivity focuses exclusively on scaling and movement effects without any color or filter changes.
You can adjust the sensitivity in script.js by modifying the threshold values:

- beatDetector.threshold: controls bass sensitivity (default: 0.15)
- midDetector.threshold: controls mid-range sensitivity (default: 0.12)
- highDetector.threshold: controls high frequency sensitivity (default: 0.10)

Lower values = more sensitive (more effects), higher values = less sensitive (fewer effects)

You can also adjust the scale factor in the applyVideoScalingEffects function:
- For stronger scaling effects: increase the multiplier (0.15) in this line:
  "const scaleFactor = 1 + (beatDetector.current - beatDetector.threshold) * 0.15;"
- For more subtle scaling effects: decrease this multiplier

Enjoy your scale-reactive music video experience!

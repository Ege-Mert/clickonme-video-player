About the Reactive Video:
- The video will react to the music by pulsing, rotating, and changing brightness
- There's a 15% padding around the video so it remains fully visible during effects
- Bass beats will make the video pulse/zoom
- Mid frequencies will adjust brightness and add slight rotation
- High frequencies will add subtle vibration/shake

The effects are designed to enhance the viewing experience without being too distracting.
You can adjust the sensitivity in script.js by modifying the threshold values:

- beatDetector.threshold: controls bass sensitivity (default: 0.15)
- midDetector.threshold: controls mid-range sensitivity (default: 0.12)
- highDetector.threshold: controls high frequency sensitivity (default: 0.10)

Lower values = more sensitive (more effects), higher values = less sensitive (fewer effects)

Enjoy the music-reactive experience!
